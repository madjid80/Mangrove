# Mangrove SDK Setup and Improvement Suggestions

1. **Unresolved Peer Dependencies**: Mangrove.js and mocha have unresolved peer dependencies.
2. **Build Failures**: Encountered errors building node-hid@npm:1.3.0 and usb@npm:1.9.2, with additional packages flagged by build failure warnings.
3. **Incorrect .env File Reference**: The command "cp .env.local.example .env.test.local" references a non-existent .env.local.example; the correct file is .env.example.
4. **Environment Variable Documentation**: Readme lacks instructions for populating environment variables with values from the Mangrove SDK preparation documentation.
5. **RPC Server Configuration**: Need detailed instructions on configuring the RPC server for local or remote connections during test runs.
6. **SDK Structure Description**: Include comprehensive documentation on the structure and components of the SDK for better user navigation and understanding.
6. **TS Config**: need to add TSConfig in readme for developers who wants to add tsconfig.
